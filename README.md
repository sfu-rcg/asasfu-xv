Installation
------------

This module relies on you to ensure the required repos are installed.  They do not need to have 'enabled=1' as this module was made to support switching repos to 'enabled' only as required by the specific module.

Usage
-----

Defaults for this module contains the repo listed in the params class and defaults to latest package version.  This may be overridden in your puppet configs by calling any of the following:

  ```puppet
  class { 'xv':
    ensure_version  => '2.1.4'
  }
  ```
  or

  ```puppet
  class { 'xv':
    required_repos  => 'epel,nux-dextop'
  }
  ```
You can use one or both values

If using hiera or the foreman to provide YAML values

  ```yaml
  ---
  classes:
    xv:
      ensure_version: 2.1.4-6.el7.nux
  ```

In the foreman you can assign an override to the parameters in this class and it will function properly
